### Core Functionality Classes

#### CheckInCore Class (core.js)
- **Error Handling**: Centralized error management with user-friendly messages
- **API Management**: Consistent API calls with session handling
- **Caching System**: Smart caching with cache invalidation
- **Utility Functions**: Shared functionality across applications

#### Timezone Handling Functions
- **epochToPacificDate()**: Convert epoch to Pacific timezone date display
- **epochToPacificTime()**: Convert epoch to Pacific timezone time display  
- **epochToPacificDateTime()**: Combined date/time conversion
- All functions handle America/Los_Angeles timezone consistently

### Development Patterns Established

#### Error Handling Pattern
```javascript
// Centralized error handling with user-friendly messages
this.handleError(error, 'context description', showToUser);
```

#### API Call Pattern
```javascript
// Consistent API calls with session management
const response = await fetch('/api/endpoint', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
    body: JSON.stringify(data)
});

if (response.status === 401) {
    this.handleSessionExpired();
    return;
}
```

#### Photo Loading Pattern
```javascript
// Lazy loading with fallbacks
${this.getLazyImageHtml(member, cssClass)}
// Followed by batched photo loading
```

### Deployment Configuration (Railway)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with DATABASE_URL environment variable
- **Photo Storage**: Persistent volumes at `/app/storage/photos`
- **Keep-Alive System**: Database warming to prevent cold starts
- **Performance**: Gzip compression and optimized queries
- **Authentication**: Session-based with configurable timeout

### Mobile-First Design Principles
- **Responsive Breakpoints**: 320px+ mobile-first design
- **Touch Targets**: Optimized button sizes for mobile interaction
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Graceful degradation for older browsers  
- **Performance**: Lazy loading and smart caching for mobile networks
- **Referee-Optimized**: Specific features for match-day referee use

### Database Schema (PostgreSQL)
- **teams**: Team management with categories
- **team_members**: Player rosters with soft delete support
- **events**: Match days and tournaments with epoch timestamps
- **matches**: Individual match configuration and results
- **referees**: Referee contact information
- **player_disciplinary_records**: Advanced disciplinary tracking
- **match_attendance**: Check-in records with timestamps

### Testing Checklist for v6.0.0

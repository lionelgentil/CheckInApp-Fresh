- **Visual Matching**: Photo comparison system between roster and mosaic
- **Target Players**: Abramadain, Brooks, Carrillo, Chavez, de Carle, Felix, Flores, Goldner, Gomez, Grubb (Adam), Grubb (David), Gutierrez, Kissinger, Klee
- **Member ID Extraction**: System to read member IDs from photo mosaic for SQL UPDATE generation

### Key Files Created

#### Photo Mosaic Files
- **photo-mosaic-complete.html**: Initial mosaic with 452 photos
- **photo-mosaic-473-complete.html**: Complete mosaic with all 473 photos
- **photo_url.txt**: Complete list of all 473 photo filenames
- **photos_clean_473.txt**: Processed photo filenames for JavaScript integration

#### Photo Integration Scripts
- **bulk-photo-update.php**: Generates single UPDATE statement with CASE logic
- **generate-photo-updates.php**: Creates individual UPDATE statements for each photo
- **photo-integration.php**: Matches photos with member records and provides statistics

### Technical Implementation

#### Photo Mosaic JavaScript
```javascript
// All 473 photos loaded dynamically
const photos = [/* 473 photo filenames */];
const baseUrl = "https://checkinapp-fresh-production.up.railway.app/photos/";

// Generate 600-cell grid (30x20)
for (let i = 0; i < totalCells; i++) {
    const cell = document.createElement('div');
    if (i < photos.length) {
        const photo = photos[i];
        const memberId = photo.split('_')[0]; // Extract member ID
        cell.innerHTML = `
            <img src="${baseUrl}${photo}" loading="lazy">
            <div class="member-id">${memberId}</div>
        `;
    } else {
        cell.classList.add('empty-cell');
    }
}
```

#### Player Name Mapping Process
1. **Visual Identification**: Compare Bandits FC roster photos with photo mosaic
2. **Member ID Extraction**: Read member IDs displayed below each photo in mosaic
3. **SQL Generation**: Create UPDATE statements to replace generic names with real names
4. **Database Update**: Execute statements to update team_members table

### Current Status & Next Steps

#### Completed
- [x] Photo mosaic system with all 473 players
- [x] Bandits FC roster analysis (14 players identified)
- [x] Visual comparison interface ready
- [x] Photo URL integration complete

#### Next Session Tasks
- [ ] **Read Member IDs**: Extract specific member IDs from photo mosaic for identified players
- [ ] **Generate SQL Updates**: Create UPDATE statements mapping member IDs to real names
- [ ] **Execute Updates**: Run SQL to replace generic "Player-ABC123" with actual names
- [ ] **Verify Results**: Confirm name updates in database
- [ ] **Extend to Other Teams**: Apply same process to remaining teams if roster data available

#### Visual Identification Progress
**Players Visually Identified in Mosaic:**
- Abramadain, Mikey (Black male with beard) - Member ID pending
- Felix, Brendon (Bald white male) - Member ID pending
- Chavez, Alberto (Hispanic male with beard) - Member ID pending
- de Carle, Davide (Male with cap) - Member ID pending
- Grubb, Adam (White male with beard) - Member ID pending
- Others pending detailed member ID extraction

### Database Schema Status
```sql
-- Current team_members structure
CREATE TABLE team_members (
    id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,           -- UUID member ID
    name TEXT,                     -- Currently "Player-ABC123" format
    team_id TEXT,                  -- Properly assigned team
    photo TEXT,                    -- Photo filename (473 photos matched)
    gender TEXT,                   -- Preserved from original data
    created_at TIMESTAMP,          -- Recovery timestamp
    FOREIGN KEY (team_id) REFERENCES teams(id)
);

-- Target update format
UPDATE team_members
SET name = 'Abramadain, Mikey'
WHERE id = '[member-id-from-mosaic]';
```

### Session Context for Continuation
**Recovery Context**: Successfully recovered entire soccer league from catastrophic data loss using match attendance fragments. All 24 teams, 473 players, and 615 photos preserved and properly integrated.

**Current Challenge**: Converting generic player names to real names using visual photo identification. Have Bandits FC roster with 14 real names/photos ready for mapping.

**Technical Approach**: Using photo mosaic as visual interface to identify players and extract member IDs for SQL UPDATE generation.

**Files Ready**: All photo integration scripts, complete mosaic HTML, and roster data prepared for name mapping execution.

// Fixed routing to handle endpoints with IDs
$pathSegments = explode('/', $path);  
$endpoint = $pathSegments[0];

switch ($endpoint) {
    case 'team-managers':
        handleTeamManagers($db, $method, $path);
        break;
```

#### Team Manager CRUD Operations
```javascript
// Create manager
async saveNewManager(event, teamId) {
    const response = await fetch('/api/team-managers', {
        method: 'POST',
        headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
        body: JSON.stringify(managerData)
    });
}

// Update manager  
async saveEditManager(event, managerId) {
    const response = await fetch(`/api/team-managers/${managerId}`, {
        method: 'PUT',
        headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
        body: JSON.stringify(managerData)
    });
}
```

#### Bulk Email System
```javascript
generateManagerEmailLink(category = null) {
    let emails = [];
    if (category) {
        // Get emails for specific category teams
        const teamsInCategory = this.teams.filter(team => team.category === category);
        const teamIds = teamsInCategory.map(team => team.id);
        emails = this.teamManagers
            .filter(manager => teamIds.includes(manager.team_id) && manager.email_address)
            .map(manager => manager.email_address);
    } else {
        // Get all manager emails
        emails = this.teamManagers
            .filter(manager => manager.email_address)
            .map(manager => manager.email_address);
    }
    return `mailto:${[...new Set(emails)].join(',')}`;
}
```

#### Player Photo Enhancement
```css
.player-card.male { border-left-color: #2196F3; }
.player-card.female { border-left-color: #e91e63; }
```

#### Mobile-First Email Links
```css
@media (max-width: 768px) {
    .email-all-managers a {
        font-size: 18px !important;
        min-height: 44px;
        display: flex;
        align-items: center;
        justify-content: center;
    }
    
    .category-header a {
        min-height: 44px;
        width: 100%;
        background: rgba(33, 150, 243, 0.1);
    }
}
```

### Database Schema
```sql
CREATE TABLE team_managers (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    team_id TEXT NOT NULL,
    first_name TEXT NOT NULL,
    last_name TEXT NOT NULL,
    phone_number TEXT,
    email_address TEXT,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    FOREIGN KEY (team_id) REFERENCES teams(id) ON DELETE CASCADE
);

CREATE INDEX idx_team_managers_team_id ON team_managers(team_id);
```

### Form Validation System
```javascript
validateManagerForm(formData) {
    const errors = [];
    
    // Required fields
    if (!formData.get('first_name')?.trim()) errors.push('First name is required');
    if (!formData.get('last_name')?.trim()) errors.push('Last name is required');
    
    // Phone validation (XXX-XXX-XXXX format)
    const phoneNumber = formData.get('phone_number')?.trim();
    if (phoneNumber) {
        const phoneRegex = /^\d{3}-\d{3}-\d{4}$/;
        if (!phoneRegex.test(phoneNumber)) {
            errors.push('Phone number must be in format: 555-555-5555');
        }
    }
    
    // Email validation
    const email = formData.get('email_address')?.trim();
    if (email) {
        const emailRegex = /^[^\s@]+@[^\s@]+\.[^\s@]+$/;
        if (!emailRegex.test(email)) {
            errors.push('Please enter a valid email address');
        }
    }
    
    return errors;
}
```

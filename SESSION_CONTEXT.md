# CheckIn App - Current Session Context

Primary Issue

  Player name updates return {"success": true} but don't persist to database after page refresh.

  Root Cause Discovered

  API routing issue in /api.php around line 237-242. The endpoint extraction logic is taking only the first path segment
  ('teams') instead of the full path ('teams/member-profile').

  Railway Logs Evidence

  [Tue Sep 30 21:07:12.068238 2025] CLAUDE DEBUG API ENTRY: path='teams/member-profile', method='POST',
  timestamp=1759266432
  [Tue Sep 30 21:07:12.068265 2025] CLAUDE DEBUG ROUTING: extracted endpoint='teams' from path='teams/member-profile'

  Required Fix

  In /api.php around line 237-242, replace the endpoint extraction logic:

  Current Code:
  // Extract the main endpoint from the path
  $pathSegments = explode('/', $path);
  $endpoint = $pathSegments[0];

  // CLAUDE DEBUG: Log the extracted endpoint
  error_log("CLAUDE DEBUG ROUTING: extracted endpoint='$endpoint' from path='$path'");

  Fixed Code:
  // Extract the main endpoint from the path
  $pathSegments = explode('/', $path);
  $endpoint = $pathSegments[0];

  // For multi-segment paths like 'teams/member-profile', use full path as endpoint
  if (count($pathSegments) > 1) {
      $fullPath = implode('/', array_slice($pathSegments, 0, 2)); // Take first 2 segments
      if (in_array($fullPath, ['teams/member-profile', 'teams/member-create', 'teams/member-delete',
  'teams/member-deactivate', 'teams/member-search-inactive', 'teams/member-reactivate'])) {
          $endpoint = $fullPath;
      }
  }

  // CLAUDE DEBUG: Log the extracted endpoint
  error_log("CLAUDE DEBUG ROUTING: extracted endpoint='$endpoint' from path='$path'");

  Current Status

  - Enhanced updateMemberProfile function is already deployed with comprehensive debugging
  - Photo console logs cleaned from app.js but not yet deployed
  - Routing fix identified but edit commands not working in current session

  Test After Fix

  Try updating a player name and verify response includes CLAUDE_DEBUG markers from the enhanced updateMemberProfile
  function instead of simple {"success": true}.

  Files Modified This Session

  1. /api.php - Enhanced updateMemberProfile function with debugging
  2. /app.js - Removed photo console logs (not yet committed)

  Key Technical Details

  - CheckIn App v6.5.0 with 24 teams, 473+ players
  - PostgreSQL database with UUID primary keys
  - API requests go to /api/teams/member-profile via .htaccess routing
  - Switch statement in api.php looks for case 'teams/member-profile' but gets 'teams'

## Session Summary
**Date**: 2025-09-26  
**Last Task Completed**: Added Team Managers display to main app Teams section

## Recent Work Completed

### 1. CSV Import System (Previous Session)
- Successfully implemented complete CSV import system for disciplinary records
- Import includes 227 historical records from "Cumulative PASS 2025 Card Data through Spring 2025 - Sheet1.csv"
- System includes dry run, actual import, SQL preview, and backup/restore functionality
- **Status**: Import completed with 173 records imported, 54 skipped, 46 errors
- **Files**: `import_disciplinary_history.php`, `csv-import-results.html`, `db-maintenance.html`

### 2. Team Managers Display (Current Session)
**JUST COMPLETED**: Successfully added Team Managers display to main app Teams section

#### Implementation Details:
1. **Data Loading** (`app.js`):
   - Added `this.teamManagers = []` property to constructor
   - Created `loadTeamManagers()` function using `/api/team-managers` endpoint
   - Added automatic loading when Teams section is accessed

2. **Display Integration** (`app.js` line ~1157):
   ```javascript
   ${teamManagers.length > 0 ? `<div class="team-manager">ðŸ’¼ Manager${teamManagers.length > 1 ? 's' : ''}: ${managerNames}</div>` : ''}
   ```

3. **Styling** (`index.html` lines 273-278):
   ```css
   .team-manager {
       font-size: 0.85em;
       color: #2196F3;
       font-weight: 600;
       margin-top: 4px;
   }
   ```

#### Key Code Changes:
- **Constructor**: Added `this.teamManagers = []` after line 104
- **loadTeamManagers()**: Added after `loadReferees()` function around line 584
- **showSection()**: Added team managers loading in teams section around line 925
- **renderTeams()**: Added manager filtering and display logic around line 1119
- **CSS**: Added `.team-manager` class after `.team-captain` around line 273

## Current App State
- **Version**: 6.4.0 (based on CLAUDE.md)
- **Main Features**: 
  - Complete team/player management with photos
  - Event/match management with check-ins
  - Disciplinary tracking system
  - Referee personalization
  - **NEW**: Team managers display in Teams section

## API Endpoints Available
- `GET /api/team-managers` - List all team managers
- `POST /api/team-managers` - Create new team manager
- `PUT /api/team-managers/{id}` - Update team manager
- `DELETE /api/team-managers/{id}` - Delete team manager
- All other existing endpoints from v6.4.0

## Database Schema
- **team_managers table**: 
  - `id` (SERIAL PRIMARY KEY)
  - `team_id` (TEXT, FK to teams.id)
  - `first_name`, `last_name` (TEXT)
  - `phone_number`, `email_address` (TEXT, optional)
  - `created_at` (TIMESTAMP)

## Files Modified in Current Session
1. **app.js**: 
   - Added team managers loading functionality
   - Added team managers display in Teams section
   - Lines modified: ~105, ~584-591, ~925-927, ~1118-1120, ~1157

2. **index.html**:
   - Added `.team-manager` CSS styling
   - Lines modified: ~273-278

## Next Possible Tasks
1. **Debug CSV Import Errors**: 46 errors from import still need investigation
2. **Manager Portal Integration**: The manager.html portal exists but could be linked from main app
3. **Team Assignment**: Could restrict managers to only see their assigned teams
4. **Manager Management**: Could add manager CRUD operations to main app

## Testing Status
- Team managers loading: âœ… Implemented
- Team managers display: âœ… Implemented  
- CSS styling: âœ… Implemented
- **Pending**: Live testing on deployed app (network access was blocked during session)

## Recovery Instructions
1. Current session focused on team managers display - implementation is complete
2. All code changes are saved and ready for testing
3. Team managers should now appear in Teams section alongside captains
4. Blue colored display with briefcase emoji (ðŸ’¼) to distinguish from captains (ðŸ‘‘)

## Connection Details
- **Deployed App**: https://checkinapp-fresh-production.up.railway.app/
- **API Base**: https://checkinapp-fresh-production.up.railway.app/api/
- **Database**: PostgreSQL on Railway
